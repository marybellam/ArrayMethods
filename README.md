Reflection:

It was difficult to get started on this assignment,as I didn't really know where to start.Things that are working well are creating the tests and methods. Although, it was difficult to figure out how to create the first test, it was easy once I figured the first test out .I am struggling to implement the methods and to read the files. I got confused on how I would implement the methods, but I understood once I asked for help. Next time, I would like to try doing the tests first then the methods, I also want to attend more TA hours.
